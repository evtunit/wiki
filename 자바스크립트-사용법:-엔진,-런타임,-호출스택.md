As JavaScript is getting more and more popular, teams are leveraging its support on many levels in their stack - front-end, back-end, hybrid apps, embedded devices and much more.

This post is meant to be the first in a series aimed at digging deeper into JavaScript and how it actually works: we thought that by knowing the building blocks of JavaScript and how they come to play together you’ll be able to write better code and apps. We’ll also share some rules of thumb we use when building SessionStack, a lightweight JavaScript application that has to be robust and highly-performant in order to stay competitive.

As shown in the GitHut stats, JavaScript is at the top in terms of Active Repositories and Total Pushes in GitHub. It doesn’t lag behind much in the other categories either.
